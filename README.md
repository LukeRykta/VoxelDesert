Game Dev Final Project

<h1>Prototype Progress Report</h1>

<h3>A brief description of what you have accomplished:</h3>

> So far, I've got a strong working menu as a foundation for the rest of my game application. I have an new game, load game, options, and quit button 
on the main page. I also have sound sliders and the basis for gameplay options and graphics options as well.

<h3>A brief description of what you have not yet accomplished:</h3>

> I still need to rebuild my levels after having lost files so I will be assembling them this week as well as finishing the menu.

<h3>Are you ahead of schedule, behind schedule, or about on track?</h3>

> I am behind schedule, but I have a lot more time and focus that can go towards building my final project so I will be catching up shortly.
